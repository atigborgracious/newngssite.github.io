                To create sustained and supportive mentor relationships for the young people in need ages 12—35.  </p><p>
The program matches youth across the country with inspirational adult mentors who can guide them in developing better self-esteem, creating healthy relationships, and making positive life choices.  
Many youths enter the program experiencing varying levels of educational difficulties or social challenges.  </p><p>

			<label class="box-close" for="acc-close"></label>
			<div class="box-content"><p>
                Through the DreamsAfrica Mentoring Campus- based model, mentors and mentees meet in a supervised environment at a set time on campus – 
                </p>
            <p>
                Though one-on-one, where one mentor is assigned to one mentee, the model is regulated to help volunteer mentors manage their schedules for consistency. The Campus-based model allows the mentoring to be done in the presence of other mentors and mentees. This provides a sense of security for these mentees of which some are yet developing their confidence and assertiveness. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Mentors who are signed onto the program commit to mentoring for an academic year 8 hours per month; although there is room for continuity of the mentoring relationship for the 3 or 4 years’ academic period depending on the outcomes of the assessments.
                </p>
                <p>
                The DreamsAfrica Mentoring programs are incubated in tertiary campuses, partnering junior High schools, and selected communities within the regions of Ghana (to be extended to other African countries).  
All Campus-based programs are supported by The DreamsAfrica Mentoring Programs Strategist who work directly with Lead Campus Coordinators to ensure the smooth running of the programs. 
                </p>
                <p>
                These Lead Campus Coordinators work together to build a conducive environment, provide resources, support systems, safety nets and training for all volunteers. The DreamsAfrica Mentoring programs incorporate a number of initiatives that helps to meet the mentee’s individual needs.
                </p>
                 <p>
 Mentors also help their mentees with career development, public speaking skills development, academic goals setting and play games that encourage socialization and Leadership. </p>

            <h4>Recruitment from Organizations/Workplaces: How The Program Works </h4>
                <p> Step 1 </p>
           <p>DreamsAfrica arranges a volunteer orientation to discuss the program’s details with prospective mentors. Professionals interested in the program complete an application and sign up for training.</p>
    <p>Step 2</p>
 <p>Volunteers attend comprehensive trainings. These trainings are mandatory. All mentors are screened using a criminal check and references.  </p>
<p>Step 3</p>
 <p>Once training and screening have been completed, DreamsAfrica matches mentors and kicks off the program! The Kick-off Party is the first event to begin the program at the corporation, school, or community site. Mentors and mentees meet for the first time at the Kick-off Party. (On Campus) </p>
<p>Step 4 </p>
<p>Mentor/mentee pairs continue to meet throughout the academic year at the designated site for a total of 6 - 8 hours per month. In the beginning, group games are introduced for mentees and mentors to get to know each other better. </p>

            <p>We are mobilizing grassroots movement for people with the knack for training and mentoring to join the campaign for mentorship. Professionals like teachers, coaches, alumni, parents and professionals in various sectors who believe in the critical need for mentoring to help champion the course. This campaign seeks to connect every youth to a meaningful relationship of trust to provide direction, support and safety net of support and opportunities for the Ghanaian and African Youth. </p>
            <p>Youth who find early mentors are able to provide leadership, have influence with their colleagues and take initiatives in their schools, homes and communities. Their academic experience, social development and economic prospects are enhanced.</p> 
            <p>It is a call to action to create opportunity for every youth.</p> 
            <p>
                
Mentors have the opportunity to give back to society, to build their leadership and management skills, expand on network, live legacies of hope and significance.
