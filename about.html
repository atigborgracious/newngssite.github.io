There is but one true and living God; maker of heaven and earth and all that is in them. We believe in God the Father, God the Son Jesus Christ and God the Holy Spirit, three in One.

 <BR/>  <BR/>


Man was created in the image of God. However, the first human beings Adam and Eve chose to disobey God and walk in sin. All mankind have inherited their sinful nature and continue to make the choice of living in sin, reaping its consequences. Therefore all have sinned and need redemption.

<BR/>   <BR/>


God in His love sent His one and only Son Jesus Christ to redeem this world by paying the full penalty for its sins. Jesus died on the cross for each one of our sins. He rose again from the dead, ascended to heaven, promised to return and sent His Holy Spirit to be with us.

                                         <BR/>  <BR/>

 

Anyone who believes in the Lord Jesus Christ and repents of their sins receives forgiveness and eternal life, irrespective of tribe, tongue, religion or nationality.
<BR/>  <BR/>

 

All who believe in Jesus will externalize their commitment to God by obeying Him in the waters of baptism, thus being initiated as disciples of Christ into His family, the Church.

 <BR/>  <BR/>


The disciples of Jesus Christ in cooperation with the Holy Spirit will overcome sin, live good lives by bearing the fruit of the Spirit and be empowered with His gifts to do the good works they were created for, thus sustaining their salvation to the very end.

 <BR/>  <BR/>


The Church is at the center of God’s purpose for this age and that God’s wisdom will be displayed to the entire universe through the Church to the praise of His glory. We believe that Christ’s central purpose is building His Church, and ultimately His kingdom; and nothing can stand in His way, even Satan and all his forces. Therefore the Church is not a building but the ‘family of God’ where individuals and families come together as His community in the midst of whom His Spirit dwells.
                                      </p>
                                   </section>
                                   
                                    <section class="col-lg-6 mt-1">
                                     <p>
                                        The Church of Jesus Christ has been called to have a dynamic relationship with the Holy Spirit, to learn, live out and teach the inspired timeless, trans-cultural truths of the Word of God. We believe that all matters concerning the life and beliefs of the churches are to be settled by the Word of God. Though the churches are to be guarded and protected by gifted leaders, all are subject to the authority of the biblical text.

  <BR/>  <BR/>


The perpetual command of the Great Commission is to take the gospel to the world. We believe that the Church, through the Holy Spirit, has the power and authority of Jesus to heal the sick, cast out demons and raise the dead. He also empowers every disciple with His gifts and power to be effective witnesses for Him in the world wide mission of making disciples.

  <BR/>  <BR/>


We believe that Christ’s strategy for building His Church can be clearly identified in Scriptures as a multiplication of churches—communities of Christians committed to maturing in Christ and to furthering the gospel of Jesus Christ.

  <BR/>  <BR/>


Each believer should fellowship and celebrate the Lord’s Supper regularly with the Church. This will serve as a way of remembering his identity with Christ and with Christ’s body, the Church, until Christ’s return.

  <BR/>  <BR/>


The glorious return of our Lord Jesus Christ for His Church is coming soon. He will judge and reward, the living and the dead and will establish His kingdom forever. Until Jesus comes again the Church is called to be in the world, yet not of the world; submit to all authority that God has placed; be prayerful and watchful and be the salt and light to the world.
