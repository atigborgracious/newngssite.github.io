              <p>
             What began as a desire and an idea, to be a big brother to his friends and the young ones in his community at an early age of 12 years has grown into a conviction of many possibilities. Eric Edem Damanka’s life has been one dedicated to leadership, talent development, training and mentoring. As founder and President of DreamsAfrica, he has been a known advocate for youth mentoring and leadership.  As a Human Resource (HR) Consultant, his experience and knowledge in raising professionals for leadership through mentoring and sponsoring and, in deploying talents across industries in Ghana has greatly shaped his conviction for this national vision. He once advanced with much certainty, ‘“I am of a strong conviction that all my life journeys, processes, experiences, education, and work, both in Academia and Industry have been so ordained to prepare me, and, to give me deeper perspectives into my vision of leadership, vocation and mentoring for the youth’’.  Shaped by the lives of the Mentors he found in his early life, at age 11, he purposed in his heart to help many other people find solace in trusted voices of wisdom, care and protection.   <br/>
His relentless passion for the transformation of lives was further fueled in college by two succinct statements of admonishing by his mother, to wit, ‘‘Brighten in the Corner where you are’’ and, ‘‘Brighten the corner where you are.’’ These wisdom words he has held onto as his commission to Personal leadership and Public leadership respectively.  On 6th April, 2013, Eric Edem Damanka rolled out a pilot leadership and mentoring project, ‘‘Creative Leadership and Mentoring Program’’ in response to several request for mentorship by some students from the University of Ghana. The multi-phased pilot project embarked upon with one of his early Mentees, Elikem Agbenyo, to provide mentorship to different enterprising student groups in the University of Ghana eventually led to the birth of DreamsAfrica. On 28th and 29th November, 2015, the first and official gathering of the Ghanaian youth to contemplate mentoring and leadership was convened at Christ the King International Parish, opposite the seat of government, The Jubilee House. This historic gathering of the youth across the country became known as the ‘‘Leaders and Mentors Summit.’’  On 19th and 20th November, 2016, DreamsAfrica hosted a patriot and the former CEO of the Ghana Chamber of Mines, Dr. Joyce Aryee and 10 carefully selected Mentors under the theme, The National Assignment: Purpose, Process and People. This second summit became the groundwork for the first five (5) weeks DreamsAfrica Leadership and Mentoring Academy program which engaged evidence-based leadership development process and training. 20 young leaders out of 76 leaders who attended the Summit were selected and sponsored to be trained in three (3) Leadership Course module namely;  1. Know Thyself (Identity and the Self Concept),  2. Beliefs and Belief Systems (Limiting and Progressive Attitude and Paradigms) and,  3. Leadership Development (Gifts, Purpose and Leadership Discovery).  <br/>
These five weeks Leadership and Mentoring Program which also hosted our founder’s Mentor, Dr Yaw Perbi, led to the unleashing of many students’ leaders including Mariam Mohammed Awal (President of the African Union Hall, Pentagon- University of Ghana, 2017) and Sroemawuda Dziedzorm Atiamoah (Vice President of History Students’ Association of Ghana, 2017). You can watch the video of their inspiring stories and journeys of leadership on the website. 
  <br/>
Mentoring programs occurred on-site at the University of Ghana Business School campus. The program has grown successfully since 2017 where mentors have been screened and matched with selected leaders and students from the University of Ghana. This had successfully laid the foundation for the NATIONAL MENTORING SUMMIT.  <br/>
 
DreamsAfrica is still reaching out to engage institutions and communities in the regions to open mentoring Centers and to train leaders to start mentoring organizations. You may reach out to us for partnership opportunities. We also invite you to get committed to this life and community transformation mission. Enroll today as a mentor, a mentee or a partner as we prepare for our NATIONAL MENTORING SUMMIT beginning 2019.   <br/>
 
We invite all Professionals, the Media, Researchers, Investors, Government Officials, Civil Society and Entrepreneurs to join the campaign for Mentoring and Leadership.
